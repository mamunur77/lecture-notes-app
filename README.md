## 📌 Project Overview

**LectureAI** is an AI/ML internship completion project that addresses a real problem faced by students — the inability to take accurate, comprehensive notes while simultaneously listening to lectures.

The application uses a two-stage AI pipeline:
1. **Groq Whisper Large v3** transcribes uploaded audio with high accuracy and speed
2. **OpenRouter LLMs** (Llama 3.3 70B, Gemma 3 27B) process the transcript to generate structured notes, flashcards, and glossaries

Built entirely with free-tier APIs making it accessible and deployable by anyone.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Students frequently miss key points during lectures because it is difficult to listen and write notes simultaneously. Existing solutions require expensive software or technical expertise. LectureAI provides an intelligent, easy-to-use platform that automates the entire note-taking process using generative AI.
